## Purpose

Learn a thing or two about neural networks.
Generate readable, speakable text.


## Keras

This project uses the [Keras Deep Learning Library](http://keras.io/)
The model design and structure is based on the example docs.


## Training Data

I found the Complete works of Shakespeare as text, and pulled
the sonnets out as a smaller training sample. Ultimately, I'd
like to generate a longer piece, but this project is in its
infancy.
